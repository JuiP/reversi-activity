## reversi-activity ##

Reversi, Othello or Yang is a game between two people, who share 64 identical cards of different faces, that are placed in turn on a board divided into 64 squares. The faces of the cards are distinguished by color and each player is assigned one of those colors, who has won more pieces on the board to finish the game.
